# Free Django workshop for women at EuroPython!

__Django Girls is an initiative that aims to introduce 19 women who have never coded before to the world of technology and increase the diversity of the European Python community. During [EuroPython 2014 in Berlin](http://europython.eu/), we're going to organize one-day workshops and invite women from all over Europe to join us and learn how to build the Internet using HTML, CSS, Python and Django.__

Workshops will take place on 21st of July, on a first day of annual EuroPython conference. Django Girls is tailored for women who have never programmed -- absolute beginners. We believe that the IT industry will greatly benefit from bringing more women into technology. We want to make an opportunity for women to learn how to program and become one of us.

Workshops are free of charge and each participant will receive free tickets to the entire EuroPython conference, courtesy of EuroPython. In addition, if an attendee can't come to Berlin due to financial reasons, but is very motivated to learn and then share their knowledge with others, we are able to provide financial support. EuroPython and the Django Software Fundation have donated funds to help such attendees meet the costs of their travel and accommodation.

__The application process starts now and ends on 30th June 2014. Applicants will receive confirmation letters by the 4th of July 2014.__

Django Girls organizers are looking for coaches and sponsors who can contribute to the event. All people and organizations who are interested are very welcome! We're also inviting individual to contribute financial support for the Django Girls initiative by buying a special support ticket for EuroPython, donating 10, 20, 50 or 100â‚¬ for the cause. Sales of these tickets starts 5th June 2014 at 6pm UTC+2.
