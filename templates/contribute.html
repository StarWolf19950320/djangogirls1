There are many ways to contribute to Django Girls: you can organize an event, coach, work on the tutorial and help on Gitter. If you don't have time but want to help, you can always support us on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/djangogirls) ‚ù§

## Organize

Each Django Girls event is a free, one-day workshop for 30-60 people about building your first application using HTML, CSS, Python and Django. A typical workshop takes 8 hours and people work in small, 3-person groups with a coach dedicated to each group.

We provide resources, tutorial and support to help local volunteers run their event.

Want to get started? Check our [Organizer's Manual](http://organize.djangogirls.org/) and [bring Django Girls to your city!](https://djangogirls.org/organize/)

## Coach

You have just heard that an event is happening in your city and went to help? You can contact the local organizing team and ask if they need more coaches!

You will help a 3-person group to install what they need for the event and guide them through our [tutorial](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/). It's a great way to share your knowledge, meet new people and contribute to increase the diversity in the Django community.

If you attended a previous event and think that coaching may be too hard, don't worry: other coaches are here to help you! You will also see that teaching helps a lot strengthen what you learned.

## Work on the tutorial

### Improve it!

Something in the tutorial is not clear or there is a typo? You can improve the tutorial by making pull request on our [Github repository](https://github.com/DjangoGirls/tutorial).

### Translate it!

A cool way to contribute to the tutorial is to help to translate it. The translation project is hosted on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/django-girls-tutorial). If you want to join a team or translate the tutorial in a new language, send us an [email!](translations@djangogirls.org)
